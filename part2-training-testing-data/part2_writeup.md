# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model is more effective becuase it can be better tested to see how effective it is. In part 1, there was no way to see how accurate it was. 

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient tells us how well the line fits with the data on the graph. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
The model is accurate, proven by the results from the testing data with the R squared value.
