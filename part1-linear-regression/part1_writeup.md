# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
The value is about 0.626 rounded, this says that there is a trend in the data. 

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old?
The blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is 137.462 (rounded).

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think that these perdictions are moderately accurate because there is a lack of data (referring to the amount of data where it would be very accurate). The more data that there is, the more information the computer has to make its calculated decisions, and I wouldn't rely on perdictions made with this amount of data.
